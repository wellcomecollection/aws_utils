- Replacing the DynamoImageFactory and DynamoImage classes with DynamoEventFactory and DynamoEvent
- Perform quite a bit of sanity checking on event object received
- DynamoEvent can return old and new images (if available)
- DynamoEvent can return modified keys only
- DynamoEvent can return deserialized or otherwise images and keys based on params
