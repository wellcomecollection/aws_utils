Welcome to Wellcome AWS Utils's documentation!
==============================================

This package is a collection of utilities written at Wellcome for interacting with AWS.

Some of these utilities are very specific to Wellcome projects, others are more generic and should be generally useful.

The best place to start is the :doc:`API reference <api>`, which describes all the utilities the package provides.
It's a bit sparse at the moment, but hopefully we'll expand it soon!
